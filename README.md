# Explain This Project

A powerful VS Code extension that analyzes your project structure and generates a comprehensive `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` file with details about languages, frameworks, dependencies, and architecture.

This is **not** a coding agent. It does not modify source code, scaffold new projects, or assume intent. It reads what exists and reports it accurately.

## ✨ Features

### **Multi-Language Support**
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** - Analyzes package.json, detects frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte, Next.js, Express, etc.)
- **Python** - Supports requirements.txt and pyproject.toml, detects Django/Flask frameworks
- **Rust** - Parses Cargo.toml, identifies applications vs libraries
- **Go** - Analyzes go.mod files and project structure
- **PHP** - Reads composer.json, detects Laravel, Symfony, CakePHP
- **Java, C#, C++, C** - Basic file extension detection
- And more...

### **Smart Project Analysis**
- **Project Name & Type** detection from configuration files
- **Framework Detection** from declared dependencies (no guesswork)
- **Entry Points** identification based on language conventions
- **Dependency Analysis** from package managers
- **Directory Structure** overview (ignores noise like node_modules)

### **Clean Output**
- Generates a well-formatted `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` file
- Structured sections for easy reading
- Timestamps for tracking when analysis was performed
- No hallucination - only reports what actually exists

## � Installation

### From VS Code Marketplace
1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X`)
3. Search for "Explain This Project"
4. Click **Install**

### From VSIX File
```bash
# Download the .vsix file, then:
code --install-extension explain-this-project-0.1.0.vsix
```

## �🚀 Usage

1. **Open a project folder** in VS Code
2. **Open Command Palette** (`Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`)
3. **Run command**: `Explain This Project`
4. **View results**: The extension creates `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` in your project root

## ⚙️ Configuration

The extension can be customized through VS Code settings:

```json
{
  "explainThisProject.includeDevDependencies": true,
  "explainThisProject.maxDirectoryDepth": 3,
  "explainThisProject.excludeDirectories": [
    "node_modules", ".git", "dist", "build", "coverage"
  ]
}
```

### Available Settings

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `includeDevDependencies` | boolean | `true` | Include development dependencies in analysis |
| `maxDirectoryDepth` | number | `3` | Maximum directory depth to analyze |
| `excludeDirectories` | array | `["node_modules", ".git", "dist", "build", "coverage"]` | Directories to exclude from analysis |

## 📋 Requirements

- VS Code 1.105.0 or higher
- An open workspace/folder (the extension analyzes the current workspace)
- No network connectivity required
- No external dependencies needed

### Development Guidelines

- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Add tests for new features
- Update documentation as needed
- Ensure all ESLint rules pass
- Test with multiple project types

## � Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Extension doesn't appear in Command Palette**
- Ensure you have a workspace/folder open in VS Code
- Restart VS Code after installation

**No PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md generated**
- Check VS Code Output panel for error messages
- Ensure you have read permissions in the project directory
- Try running on a simpler project first

**Incomplete analysis**
- Check if configuration files (package.json, etc.) are valid JSON/TOML
- Verify the project structure matches expected patterns
- Review excluded directories in settings

**Performance issues with large projects**
- Reduce `maxDirectoryDepth` in settings
- Add large directories to `excludeDirectories`
- Consider analyzing subdirectories separately

### Getting Help

1. Check the [Issues page](https://github.com/peterbenoit/explain-this-project/issues) for similar problems
2. Enable VS Code Developer Tools (`Help > Toggle Developer Tools`) to see console errors
3. Create a minimal reproduction case
4. Open a new issue with:
   - VS Code version
   - Extension version
   - Project type and structure
   - Error messages or logs
