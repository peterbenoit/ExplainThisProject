# Explain This Project

**Instantly understand any codebase.**

Ever feel lost when you open a new project? "Explain This Project" is your personal guide. It scans your project, analyzes its structure, and writes a clear, comprehensive `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` file for you in seconds.

It's like having a senior developer give you a tour of the project—without the wait.

## Features

### **Smart Project Analysis**
The extension automatically detects:
- **Programming languages** (JavaScript, Python, Rust, Go, and more)
- **Frameworks** (React, Vue, Express, Django, Flask, Laravel, etc.)
- **Dependencies** and development tools
- **Entry points** and key project files
- **Directory structure** (ignores noise like `node_modules`)

### **Multi-Language Support**
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** - Analyzes `package.json`, detects frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte, Next.js, Express, etc.)
- **Python** - Supports `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml`, detects Django/Flask frameworks
- **Rust** - Parses `Cargo.toml`, identifies applications vs libraries
- **Go** - Analyzes `go.mod` files and project structure
- **PHP** - Reads `composer.json`, detects Laravel, Symfony, CakePHP
- **Java, C#, C++, C** - Basic file extension detection

### **Clean, Structured Output**
- Generates a well-formatted `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` file
- Organized sections for easy reading
- Timestamped for tracking when analysis was performed
- No guesswork—only reports what actually exists
