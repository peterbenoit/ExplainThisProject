# 🚀 Explain This Project: Instant Project Documentation

Ever feel lost when you open a new codebase? "Explain This Project" is your personal guide. It scans your project, figures out what's inside, and writes a clear, simple `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` file for you.

It's like having a senior developer give you a tour of the project, but it only takes a few seconds.

## ✨ Why You'll Love It

*   **Onboard Faster:** Jump into a new project and understand its structure in minutes, not days.
*   **Save Time:** No more digging through `package.json` files or hunting for the main entry point. Get a high-level summary instantly.
*   **Collaborate Better:** Generate a clear overview to share with your team, making sure everyone is on the same page.
*   **Works Offline:** No internet connection needed. Your code stays on your machine.

## How It Works

It's as simple as 1-2-3:

1.  **Open any project** in VS Code.
2.  Run the **"Explain This Project"** command from the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`).
3.  **Done!** A new `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` file appears in your project root, ready to read.

The extension automatically detects:
*   Programming languages (JavaScript, Python, Rust, Go, and more)
*   Frameworks (React, Vue, Express, Django, Flask, etc.)
*   Dependencies and development tools
*   Key project files and directory structure

## Get Started

Install the extension, open a project, and give it a try!
